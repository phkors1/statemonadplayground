Installing SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html

Call the following sbt commands to tinker with this project:

sbt compile      - to build the project
sbt console      - to drop into REPL with a suitable classpath setup for your project
sbt clean        - remove sbt generated files
sbt run          - run the main method if you have such (for instance via App)

After the console command, the REPL is loaded with a suitably setup CLASSPATH.
So you can for example do:

> import adpro.Exercise85_TestCases._

The REPL will find all the class files (with sbt we shall almost always
compile our scala files, and load the objects into the REPL from class files.
Then we can use the REPL to interact with them and debug stuff.)

The following two targets are useful in testing:

sbt test         - to run the scalacheck tests
sbt test:console - drop into REPL with classpath configured for testing classes

IntelliJ people will find out that IntelliJ can somehow import the build.sbt
file to offer the same services (and perhaps they already used them
implicitly).  I do not know about Eclipse unfortunately.  In any case, you are
on your own if you are not calling sbt directly :).

You will find the source files in src/main/scala/* in sbt managed projects. The
test files are in src/test/scala/*.
